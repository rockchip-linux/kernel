 * @reg_rbtree_exec_fixed: RB tree of the memory regions allocated from the

 *                        This is usually, but not necessarily, the same as the
 *                        process whose thread opened the device file
 *                        /dev/malixx instance.
 * @pid:                  ID of the thread, corresponding to process @tgid,

 * @csf:                  kbase csf context
 * @jctx:                 object encapsulating all the Job dispatcher related state,

 * @used_pages:           Keeps a track of the number of 4KB physical pages in use
 *                        for the context.
 * @nonmapped_pages:      Updated in the same way as @used_pages, except for the case
 *                        when special tracking page is freed by userspace where it
 *                        is reset to 0.
 * @permanent_mapped_pages: Usage count of permanently mapped memory
 * @mem_pools:            Context-specific pools of free physical memory pages.
 * @reclaim:              Shrinker object registered with the kernel containing
 *                        the pointer to callback function which is invoked under
 *                        low memory conditions. In the callback function Driver
 *                        frees up the memory for allocations marked as
 *                        evictable/reclaimable.
 * @evict_list:           List head for the list containing the allocations which
 *                        can be evicted or freed up in the shrinker callback.
 * @evict_nents:          Total number of pages allocated by the allocations within
 *                        @evict_list (atomic).
 * @waiting_soft_jobs:    List head for the list containing softjob atoms, which
 *                        are either waiting for the event set operation, or waiting
 *                        for the signaling of input fence or waiting for the GPU
 *                        device to powered on so as to dump the CPU/GPU timestamps.
 * @waiting_soft_jobs_lock: Lock to protect @waiting_soft_jobs list from concurrent
 *                        accesses.
 * @dma_fence:            Object containing list head for the list of dma-buf fence
 *                        waiting atoms and the waitqueue to process the work item
 *                        queued for the atoms blocked on the signaling of dma-buf
 *                        fences.
 * @dma_fence.waiting_resource: list head for the list of dma-buf fence
 * @dma_fence.wq:         waitqueue to process the work item queued
 * @as_nr:                id of the address space being used for the scheduled in
 *                        context. This is effectively part of the Run Pool, because
 *                        it only has a valid setting (!=KBASEP_AS_NR_INVALID) whilst
 *                        the context is scheduled in. The hwaccess_lock must be held
 *                        whilst accessing this.
 *                        If the context relating to this value of as_nr is required,
 *                        then the context must be retained to ensure that it doesn't
 *                        disappear whilst it is being used. Alternatively, hwaccess_lock
 *                        can be held to ensure the context doesn't disappear (but this
 *                        has restrictions on what other locks can be taken simutaneously).
 * @refcount:             Keeps track of the number of users of this context. A user
 *                        can be a job that is available for execution, instrumentation
 *                        needing to 'pin' a context for counter collection, etc.
 *                        If the refcount reaches 0 then this context is considered
 *                        inactive and the previously programmed AS might be cleared
 *                        at any point.
 *                        Generally the reference count is incremented when the context
 *                        is scheduled in and an atom is pulled from the context's per
 *                        slot runnable tree in JM GPU or GPU command queue
 *                        group is programmed on CSG slot in CSF GPU.
 * @process_mm:           Pointer to the memory descriptor of the process which
 *                        created the context. Used for accounting the physical
 *                        pages used for GPU allocations, done for the context,
 *                        to the memory consumed by the process. A reference is taken
 *                        on this descriptor for the Userspace created contexts so that
 *                        Kbase can safely access it to update the memory usage counters.
 *                        The reference is dropped on context termination.
 * @gpu_va_end:           End address of the GPU va space (in 4KB page units)
 * @running_total_tiler_heap_nr_chunks: Running total of number of chunks in all

 *                        created internally by the Kbase.
 *
 * A kernel base context is an entity among which the GPU is scheduled.
 * Each context has its own GPU address space.
 * Up to one context can be created for each client that opens the device file
 * /dev/malixx. Context creation is deferred until a special ioctl() system call
 * is made on the device file.
