 * Backend-specific Power Manager MCU state definitions.
 * The function-like macro KBASEP_MCU_STATE() must be defined before including

 * same compilation unit with different definitions of KBASEP_MCU_STATE().
 *
 * @OFF:                                The MCU is powered off.
 * @PEND_ON_RELOAD:                     The warm boot of MCU or cold boot of MCU (with
 *                                      firmware reloading) is in progress.
 * @ON_GLB_REINIT_PEND:                 The MCU is enabled and Global configuration
 *                                      requests have been sent to the firmware.
 * @ON_HWCNT_ENABLE:                    The Global requests have completed and MCU is now
 *                                      ready for use and hwcnt is being enabled.
 * @ON:                                 The MCU is active and hwcnt has been enabled.
 * @ON_CORE_ATTR_UPDATE_PEND:           The MCU is active and mask of enabled shader cores
 *                                      is being updated.
 * @ON_HWCNT_DISABLE:                   The MCU is on and hwcnt is being disabled.
 * @ON_HALT:                            The MCU is on and hwcnt has been disabled, MCU
 *                                      halt would be triggered.
 * @ON_PEND_HALT:                       MCU halt in progress, confirmation pending.
 * @POWER_DOWN:                         MCU halted operations, pending being disabled.
 * @PEND_OFF:                           MCU is being disabled, pending on powering off.
 * @RESET_WAIT:                         The GPU is resetting, MCU state is unknown.
 * @HCTL_SHADERS_PEND_ON:               Global configuration requests sent to the firmware
 *                                      have completed and shaders have been requested to
 *                                      power on.
 * @HCTL_CORES_NOTIFY_PEND:             Shader cores have powered up and firmware is being
 *                                      notified of the mask of enabled shader cores.
 * @HCTL_MCU_ON_RECHECK:                MCU is on and hwcnt disabling is triggered
 *                                      and checks are done to update the number of
 *                                      enabled cores.
 * @HCTL_SHADERS_READY_OFF:             MCU has halted and cores need to be powered down
 * @HCTL_SHADERS_PEND_OFF:              Cores are transitioning to power down.
 * @HCTL_CORES_DOWN_SCALE_NOTIFY_PEND:  Firmware has been informed to stop using
 *                                      specific cores, due to core_mask change request.
 *                                      After the ACK from FW, the wait will be done for
 *                                      undesired cores to become inactive.
 * @HCTL_CORE_INACTIVE_PEND:            Waiting for specific cores to become inactive.
 *                                      Once the cores become inactive their power down
 *                                      will be initiated.
 * @HCTL_SHADERS_CORE_OFF_PEND:         Waiting for specific cores to complete the
 *                                      transition to power down. Once powered down,
 *                                      HW counters will be re-enabled.
 * @ON_SLEEP_INITIATE:                  MCU is on and hwcnt has been disabled and MCU
 *                                      is being put to sleep.
 * @ON_PEND_SLEEP:                      MCU sleep is in progress.
 * @IN_SLEEP:                           Sleep request is completed and MCU has halted.
 * @ON_PMODE_ENTER_CORESIGHT_DISABLE:   The MCU is on, protected mode enter is about to
 *                                      be requested, Coresight is being disabled.
 * @ON_PMODE_EXIT_CORESIGHT_ENABLE :    The MCU is on, protected mode exit has happened
 *                                      Coresight is being enabled.
 * @CORESIGHT_DISABLE:                  The MCU is on and Coresight is being disabled.
 * @CORESIGHT_ENABLE:                   The MCU is on, host does not have control and
 *                                      Coresight is being enabled.
