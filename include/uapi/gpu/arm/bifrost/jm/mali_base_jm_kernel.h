 * could increase its context priority, causing its non-fragment atoms to also
 * be scheduled sooner.
 *
 * The atoms are scheduled as follows with respect to their priorities:
 * * Let atoms 'X' and 'Y' be for the same job slot who have dependencies
 *   resolved, and atom 'X' has a higher priority than atom 'Y'
 * * If atom 'Y' is currently running on the HW, then it is interrupted to
 *   allow atom 'X' to run soon after
 * * If instead neither atom 'Y' nor atom 'X' are running, then when choosing
 *   the next atom to run, atom 'X' will always be chosen instead of atom 'Y'
 * * Any two atoms that have the same priority could run in any order with
 *   respect to each other. That is, there is no ordering constraint between
 *   atoms of the same priority.
 *
 * The sysfs file 'js_ctx_scheduling_mode' is used to control how atoms are
 * scheduled between contexts. The default value, 0, will cause higher-priority
 * atoms to be scheduled first, regardless of their context. The value 1 will
 * use a round-robin algorithm when deciding which context's atoms to schedule
 * next, so higher-priority atoms can only preempt lower priority atoms within
 * the same context. See KBASE_JS_SYSTEM_PRIORITY_MODE and
 * KBASE_JS_PROCESS_LOCAL_PRIORITY_MODE for more details.

 *                                  entry at level 4 of the translation table.
 * @BASE_JD_EVENT_PERMISSION_FAULT: A memory access could not be allowed due to
 *                                  the permission flags set in translation

 * @BASE_JD_EVENT_TRANSTAB_BUS_FAULT_LEVEL4: A bus fault occurred while reading
 *                                  level 3 of the translation tables.
 * @BASE_JD_EVENT_ACCESS_FLAG:      Matches ACCESS_FLAG_0. A memory access hit a
 *                                  translation table entry with the ACCESS_FLAG
 *                                  bit set to zero in level 0 of the
 *                                  page table, and the DISABLE_AF_FAULT flag
 *                                  was not set.
 * @BASE_JD_EVENT_MEM_GROWTH_FAILED: raised for JIT_ALLOC atoms that failed to
 *                                   grow memory on demand
 * @BASE_JD_EVENT_JOB_CANCELLED: raised when this atom was hard-stopped or its
 *                               dependencies failed
 * @BASE_JD_EVENT_JOB_INVALID: raised for many reasons, including invalid data
 *                             in the atom which overlaps with
 *                             BASE_JD_EVENT_JOB_CONFIG_FAULT, or if the
 *                             platform doesn't support the feature specified in
 *                             the atom.
 * @BASE_JD_EVENT_DRV_TERMINATED: this is a special event generated to indicate
 *                                to userspace that the KBase context has been
 *                                destroyed and Base should stop listening for
 *                                further events
 * @BASE_JD_EVENT_REMOVED_FROM_NEXT: raised when an atom that was configured in
 *                                   the GPU has to be retried (but it has not
 *                                   started) due to e.g., GPU reset
 * @BASE_JD_EVENT_END_RP_DONE: this is used for incremental rendering to signal
 *                             the completion of a renderpass. This value
 *                             shouldn't be returned to userspace but I haven't
 *                             seen where it is reset back to JD_EVENT_DONE.
 *
 * HW and low-level SW events are represented by event codes.
 * The status of jobs which succeeded are also represented by
 * an event code (see @BASE_JD_EVENT_DONE).
 * Events are usually reported as part of a &struct base_jd_event.
 *
 * The event codes are encoded in the following way:
 * * 10:0  - subtype
 * * 12:11 - type
 * * 13    - SW success (only valid if the SW bit is set)
 * * 14    - SW event (HW event if not set)
 * * 15    - Kernel event (should never be seen in userspace)
 *
 * Events are split up into ranges as follows:
 * * BASE_JD_EVENT_RANGE_<description>_START
 * * BASE_JD_EVENT_RANGE_<description>_END
 *
 * code is in <description>'s range when:
 * BASE_JD_EVENT_RANGE_<description>_START <= code <
 *   BASE_JD_EVENT_RANGE_<description>_END
 *
 * Ranges can be asserted for adjacency by testing that the END of the previous
 * is equal to the START of the next. This is useful for optimizing some tests
 * for range.
 *
 * A limitation is that the last member of this enum must explicitly be handled
 * (with an assert-unreachable statement) in switch statements that use
 * variables of this type. Otherwise, the compiler warns that we have not
 * handled that enum value.

 *   clGetDeviceInfo()
 * @log2_program_counter_size: Size of the shader program counter, in bits.
 * @texture_features: TEXTURE_FEATURES_x registers, as exposed by the GPU. This

 *   (Bifrost) GPUs, where GPU_HAS_REG_CORE_FEATURES is defined. Otherwise,
 *   this is always 0.
