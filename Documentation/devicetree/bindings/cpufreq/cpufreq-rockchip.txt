Binding for Rockchip's CPUFreq driver
===============================

Rockchip's CPUFreq driver attempts to read leakage value from eFuse
and get frequency count from pvtm, then supplies the OPP framework
with 'prop' information which is used to determine opp-microvolt-<name>
property of OPPS when it is parsed by the OPP framework. This is based
on operating-points-v2, but the driver can also create the "cpufreq-dt"
platform_device to compatibility with operating-points.

For more information about the expected DT format [See: ../opp/rockchip-opp.txt].
