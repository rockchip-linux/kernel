NVIDIA Tegra Power Management Controller (PMC)

The PMC block interacts with an external Power Management Unit. The PMC
mostly controls the entry and exit of the system from different sleep
modes. It provides power-gating controllers for SoC and CPU power-islands.

Required properties:
- name : Should be pmc
- compatible : Should contain "nvidia,tegra<chip>-pmc".
- reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
- clocks : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names : Must include the following entries:
  "pclk" (The Tegra clock of that name),
  "clk32k_in" (The 32KHz clock input to Tegra).

Optional properties:
- nvidia,invert-interrupt : If present, inverts the PMU interrupt signal.
  The PMU is an external Power Management Unit, whose interrupt output
  signal is fed into the PMC. This signal is optionally inverted, and then
  fed into the ARM GIC. The PMC is not involved in the detection or
  handling of this interrupt signal, merely its inversion.
- nvidia,suspend-mode : The suspend mode that the platform should use.
  Valid values are 0, 1 and 2:
  0 (LP0): CPU + Core voltage off and DRAM in self-refresh
  1 (LP1): CPU voltage off and DRAM in self-refresh
  2 (LP2): CPU voltage off
- nvidia,core-power-req-active-high : Boolean, core power request active-high
- nvidia,sys-clock-req-active-high : Boolean, system clock request active-high
- nvidia,combined-power-req : Boolean, combined power request for CPU & Core
- nvidia,cpu-pwr-good-en : Boolean, CPU power good signal (from PMIC to PMC)
			   is enabled.

Required properties when nvidia,suspend-mode is specified:
- nvidia,cpu-pwr-good-time : CPU power good time in uS.
- nvidia,cpu-pwr-off-time : CPU power off time in uS.
- nvidia,core-pwr-good-time : <Oscillator-stable-time Power-stable-time>
			      Core power good time in uS.
- nvidia,core-pwr-off-time : Core power off time in uS.

Hardware-triggered thermal reset:
On Tegra30, Tegra114 and Tegra124, if the 'i2c-thermtrip' subnode exists,
hardware-triggered thermal reset will be enabled.

Required properties for hardware-triggered thermal reset (inside 'i2c-thermtrip'):
- nvidia,pmu : Phandle to power management unit / PMIC handling poweroff
- nvidia,reg-addr : I2C register address to write poweroff command to
- nvidia,reg-data : Poweroff command to write to PMU

Optional properties for hardware-triggered thermal reset (inside 'i2c-thermtrip'):
- nvidia,pinmux-id : Pinmux used by the hardware when issuing poweroff command.
                     Defaults to 0.
