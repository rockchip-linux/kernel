dma-buf-test-exporter
=====================

Overview
--------

The dma-buf-test-exporter is a simple exporter of dma_buf objects.
It has a private API to allocate and manipulate the buffers which are represented as dma_buf fds.
The private API allows:
* simple allocation of physically non-contiguous buffers
* simple allocation of physically contiguous buffers
* query kernel side API usage stats (number of attachments, number of mappings, mmaps)
* failure mode configuration (fail attach, mapping, mmap)
* kernel side memset of buffers

The buffers support all of the dma_buf API, including mmap.

It supports being compiled as a module both in-tree and out-of-tree.

See include/uapi/base/arm/dma_buf_test_exporter/dma-buf-test-exporter.h for the ioctl interface.
See Documentation/dma-buf-sharing.txt for details on dma_buf.
