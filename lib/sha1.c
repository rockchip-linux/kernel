 * with a 'W(t)=(val);asm("":"+m" (W(t))' there instead, as
 * suggested by Artur Skawina - that will also make gcc unable to
 * try to do the silly "optimize away loads" part because it won't
 * see what the value will be).
 *
 * Ben Herrenschmidt reports that on PPC, the C version comes close
 * to the optimized asm with this (ie on PPC you don't want that
 * 'volatile', since there are lots of registers).
 *
 * On ARM we get the best code generation by forcing a full memory barrier
 * between each SHA_ROUND, otherwise gcc happily get wild with spilling and
 * the stack frame size simply explode and performance goes down the drain.
